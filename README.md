This project was made inspired by Alura's Dev Immersion challenges and by my love for basketball and NBA.

Add your favorite players highlight mixtapes and create a cool catalog to enjoy them whenever you want!  

## Technologies used in the project  🛠️

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript

## Disclaimer 🗣

Unfortunatelly, at this moment, I'm still learning methods to store the data added by users on websites. Therefore, the added players will vanish (😢<s>lost in time, like tears in rain🌧</s>) when you refresh the page.\
Feel free to contact me if you have the solution for this "problem" and want to help me to implementate!
